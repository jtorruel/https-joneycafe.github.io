This project is a professional website for a Chilean-oriented café restaurant. The site is designed to showcase the café’s unique identity and offerings, including:

Story and inspiration behind the café

Signature Chilean dishes and specialties

Key information (location, hours, reservation options)

Contact details

A dedicated take order section allowing customers to place orders online for pickup or delivery

The website features a clean, inviting layout that allows guests to easily explore the menu, learn about the café’s Chilean roots, and make reservations or place orders directly through the site. The online ordering system is seamlessly integrated to provide a smooth, commission-free experience, helping to increase sales and customer retention by making ordering fast and convenient. This project demonstrates my ability to build restaurant-focused websites with user-friendly features, culturally relevant content, and modern e-commerce capabilities, following best practices seen in top café and restaurant sites.
